      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hey, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Austin, and
        I'm thrilled that you've taken the time to visit my piece of the
        internet.

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a {age} year old Web Developer located in Illinois, with a deep passion
        for the web and its sorounding technology. I've always been facinated by
        creating digital experiences, and I'm on a mission to create them myself.

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I had my first experience with web development years ago when I built a
        small website as a class project. That site was some of most crude code
        I've ever written, yet it ignited a spark of continuous learning and
        development. Now, I am still continuing to learn little by little every
        day; finding myself naturally curious with a drive to continue growing
        my skills in web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professoinally, I primarily work with Elm and SCSS to build front-end
        pages. While, ocassionally working with .NET Razor or React, when the
        need arises.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I enjoy working in Vue and Nuxt on my personal web
        projects. And when I'm not working on the web, I have taken enjoyment in
        working in Rust.

      <h2>Outside of the Office</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of work I have many different interests. I enjoy lifting weights
        to relief stress and keep healthy. I also enjoy the occasional hike or
        bike ride to get outside and experience the beauty of nature. And
        recently, I have been learning how to fly-fish on the weekends.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the weather doesn't let me get outside, I enojoy playing casual
        video games with my friends, or and watching a good movie or TV show.
