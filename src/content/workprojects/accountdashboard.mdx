## Building the New Account Dashboard

Building the account dashboard page was an exciting project and an opportunity to build a brand new page for users to interact with their account information. Previously when coming to their accounts users would be greeted with their profile information. Now, users are greeted with recent order information, a preview of new product arrivals, and and ease of access to their account information.
