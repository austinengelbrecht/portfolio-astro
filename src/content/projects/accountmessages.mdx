## Rebuilding The Account Messages Page

The Account Messages page on an e-commerce website serves as vital point of sharing important information between the company and its users. The page facilitates on-site information sharing about order updates, promotions, customer support, product arrivals, and more information. By revamping this page, the goal is to enhance the user experience, streamline communication, and ultimately boost customer satisfaction and retention.

### My Role

As the primary developer for this project, my role was pivotal for bringing the new Account Messages page design to life. I collaborated closely with the primary designer to understand the projects goal and translate them into technical requirements. My responsibilities encompassed front-end development, ensuring responsiveness across different devices and browsers, while also focusing on optimizing page performance. During this process, I crafted a new DOM using Elm, built the styling with SCSS, and ensured back-end functionality to support bringing the correct data to the front end.

### User Research

The process of rebuilding the Account Messages page involved several key steps. First, beyond an outdated ui, we performed an analysis of the current state of the page through user feedback, pain points, and identified common usage patterns. This analysis was achieved through user testing and analytical data.

Once data analysis was complete, the primary designer did initial benchmarking of competitor websites and other industry leaders. This created fuller picture of what user expect from other sites they are browsing, and gave us a starting point for new features we wanted to implement.

An initial MVP was created, which featured an updated styling that was more concise and easy to read, was mobile friendly, and had the ability to be expanded upon for future messages and features.
